In Fall, the start our fiscal year, we try to be mostly outside for meetings with activities like geocaching, short hiking trips, and Conoeing. The winter is a busy time for us. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas we sell Christmas tree which is the main fundraiser we do. We also partisipate in the Klondike Derby, Scout Day at Pats Peak Ski are, and sometimes we plan a trip to Canada where we visited parlament and other fun places around Quebec. In the spring we start camping and hiking. The summer brings summer camp at Hidden Valley or Camp Bell. Sometimes we plan our own trip.
